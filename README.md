please read this document to understand how the code works and the function of each modules in the file tree.

### How does the code works
- We use process builder to call python code base that does the computation in java. Please [read](https://www.baeldung.com/java-working-with-python) how we can call python function from java. 

### How to set up the system
- Install [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html) IDEA.
- Once you install Intellij, go to ```File``` -> ```Project Structure``` -> ```Modules``` and add Python 3.9 and java 13.0.1. You can find more information about how to set up your modules here. You need to have two modules, one for python and another for java. [Check this link and follow the instruction under ```Add a library to module dependencies```ï»¿
](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/library.html#define-a-module-library)
- Once you added both Python and Java, you should have module structures as follow.
